    <h2>But wait! There's more...</h2>
    <p>
      On the basic widget pages, we've included the simplest (in our mind) examples of the widgets. But there's so
      much more you can do with these guys.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In these example pages we've included some other ways in which you can use the widgets. For example, rather
		  than a toggler just being an accordion (as we saw in its <a href="toggler.html">widget page</a>), we can make
		  it into a pop-up.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Even though there's a fair few of them here, the examples aren't exhaustive. The flexibility of the widgets
		  means that it's only really down to the imaginability with your CSS!
