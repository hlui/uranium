    <h2>Sets vs IDs</h2>

    <p>In Uranium, we can group widgets in two ways: sets and ids. A set is when the whole 
      widget is wrapped in a div (or other tag) with the attribute <span class="inline_code">data-ur-set="widget"</span>.</p>

    <p>An id is where every component of the widget is given a unique id attribute. For example,
      giving the attribute <span class="inline_code">data-ur-toggler-id="unique_id"</span>. So, this is an alternative way to
      group a set of divs.</p>

    <p>It's generally a better practice to use <span class="inline_code">data-ur-set</span>. This allows for better, well-structured
      and hierarchical HTML. However, it isn't possible in all cases to add this attribute. It's
      in these instances we use <span class="inline_code">data-ur-widget-id</span> attributes. </p>

    <h2>How Uranium Works</h2>

    <p>Uranium searches through the HTML document for the special attributes
      we give to tags. Once it sees the <span class="inline_code">data-ur</span>, it looks for groups of components. 
      The set allows it to determine what widget we're defining.</p>

    <p>Next, the javascript looks for ids on a component. If it finds an
      id, it uses this. If it <emph>doesn't</emph>, it uses the set.</p>
  
    <p>This is explained visually in the flowchart below.</p>
