    <h1>Grouping</h1>
      <h2>Sets vs IDs</h2>
      
      <p>In Uranium, we can group widgets in two ways: sets and ids. A set is when the whole 
        widget is wrapped in a div (or other tag) with the attribute data-ur-set="widget".</p>
      
      <p>An id is where every component of the widget is given a unique id attribute. For example,
        giving the attribute data-ur-toggler-id="unique_id". So, this is an alternative way to
        group a set of divs.</p>
      
      <p>It's generally a better practice to use data-ur-set. This allows for better, well-structured
        and hierarchical HTML. However, it isn't possible in all cases to add this attribute. It's
        in these instances we use data-ur-widget-id attributes. </p>

      <h2>How Uranium Works</h2>
      
      <p>Uranium searches through the HTML document for the special attributes
        we give to tags. Once it sees the data-ur, it looks for groups of components. 
        The set allows it to determine what widget we're defining.</p>
      
      <p>Next, the javascript looks for ids on a component. If it finds an
        id, it uses this. If it <emph>doesn't</emph>, it uses</p>
        
      <p>This is explained visually in the flowchart below.</p>
