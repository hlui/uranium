    <div id="lazy_vs_proper">
      <h2>Lazy and Proper Styling</h2>
    
      <p>There are two types of styling for Uranium widgets. One we generally refer to as
        "lazy" styling, the other as "proper" styling. Lazy styling requires fewer lines of
        CSS, but proper styling is really the best way to style your widgets.</p>
      <div class="styling">
        <h3>Lazy Styling</h3>
      
        <p>As its name implies, lazy styling is simpler and faster to do. You only really
          need to write out two declaration blocks. The first covers the element in its
          non-enabled state, and the other when the element is enabled.</p>
        
        <p>Say we're styling a toggler button. When "enabled", we want it to be full opacity. However, 
          when disabled we want it to be at 50% opacity. Pretty simple using the following CSS:</p>
          
        <p class="code">
          *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 0.5;</br>
          }</br></br>

          *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='enabled'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 1.0;</br>
          }
        </p>
        
        <p>Its default state (the first block) describes its color and that it should be at 50% opacity.
          The second block says that when the button is enabled, it will be at 100% opacity. Simple. See
          how it works by clicking on the button below. </p>
        
        <div data-ur-toggler-component='button' data-ur-id='LazyPopup' >
          Popup !
        </div>

        <div data-ur-toggler-component='content' data-ur-id='LazyPopup'>
           <img src='images/popup.jpeg'>
        </div>
        
        <p>However, lazy styling can cause problems. Let's take a look at a better way to
          style widgets.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="styling">
        <h3>Proper Styling</h3>
        
        <p>The problem with lazy styling is this: you're only really saying what the
          element looks like when the data-ur-state is <i>enabled</i>. We're taking it 
          for granted that the non-enabled state is the same as the disabled state. This
          is an OK assumption to make in most cases.</p>
        
        <p>But this isn't actually the case. What actually happens is that the element
          goes through a brief period without any data-ur-state before Uranium assigns
          the default (which is usually disabled). (Of course, this doesn't
          apply if you specify in your HTML that the element has a data-ur-set.)</p>
        
        <p>So when we style the non-enabled state in lazy styling, we're actually styling
          <i>two</i> states - the one before any state has been assigned AND the "disabled"
          state.</p>
        
        <p>How can this be exploited? Well, we can have three separate states. When the page
          first loads, the CSS that's applied will be anything without a data-ur-state specified.
          Then we can style for the enabled and disabled states separately.</p>
        
        <p class="code">
          .popup_button*[data-ur-toggler-component='button'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: blue;</br>
          }</br></br>
          
          .popup_button*[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='disabled'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 0.5;</br>
          }</br></br>

          .popup_button*[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='enabled'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 1.0;</br>
          }
        </p>
        
        <p>So when the page loads, the button will be blue. When its clicked on, the button
          will be enabled and made red. When it is clicked on again, making it disabled,
          it will have 50% opacity. Check it out below.</p>
  
        <div data-ur-toggler-component='button' data-ur-id='ProperPopup'
           class='popup_button'>
          Popup !
        </div>

        <div data-ur-toggler-component='content' data-ur-id='ProperPopup'
          data-ur-state='disabled' class='popup_content'>
           <img src='images/popup.jpeg'>
        </div>
        
        <p>The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that in the second example, we're
          including a class to our CSS selectors. This is to make them "stronger". In CSS,
          some selectors can override others.</p>
        
        <p>And that's how (and why) we should style things properly, rather than lazily.</p>
