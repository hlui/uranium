      <h3>Uranium is lightweight</h3>
        <p>Uranium is only 8.4KB when zipped. It was made in xui, a super-light mobile javascript library.
          This makes it perfect for mobile devices, where minimizing KB is essential. It's also possible
          to make a custom build if you need it to be even lighter.
          </p>
 
      <h3>Uranium is easy to use</h3>
        <p>No javascript knowledge is necessary to use Uranium.
          (Of course, if you do know javascript, it allows you to play around with the widgets.)
          </p>

      <h3>Uranium is pliable</h3>
        <p>Uranium bundles with <a href="xuijs.com">xui</a> -- which (we think) provides a great minimal set of convenient 
          javascript functions (query, add-listeners, ajax, iterate, etc). With this in mind, Uranium is the 
          best of both worlds - its primary purpose is to make it easy to create great widgets UI/UX, but if 
          you need to do something fancy, it gives you the tools you need to do so concisely.</p>
          
      <h3>Uranium is not designed for executing logic or site functions</h3>
        <p>Uranium makes the view (your UI/UX) rely on the model (your HTML). The declarative aspect 
          is not designed for performing functions. You wouldn't want to add attributes to an element 
          to perform some js logic (this is exactly why 'onclicks' should be avoided) - thats what 
          events/listeners/callbacks are for.</p>
