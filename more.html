    <h2> Philosophy </h2>
      <h3>Uranium is lightweight</h3>
        <p>Uranium is only 8.4KB when zipped.
          This makes it perfect for mobile devices, where minimizing KB is essential. It's also possible
          to make a custom build if you need it to be even lighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranium was made in xui. <a href="http://xuijs.com/">Xui</a> is a featherweight mobile javascript library that was used to develop Uranium.
            Uranium is bundled with xui to make just one javascript file. This makes it perfect for
            mobile devices, where minimizing the amount of data downloaded is key.
            If you want it even lighter, you can make a custom build yourself.
  				</p>
 
      <h3>Uranium is easy to use</h3>
        <p>No javascript knowledge is necessary to use Uranium.
          (Of course, if you do know javascript, it allows you to play around with the widgets.)
          </p>
         <p>  That's right: you don't need to touch a single line of javascript. It uses the 
           'declarative' javascript style, a model that looks for how 
          HTML elements are formatted. Then, it constructs all the necessary javascript magic to make those 
          elements come to life.</p>

      <h3>Uranium is pliable</h3>
        <p>Uranium bundles with <a href="xuijs.com">xui</a> -- which (we think) provides a great minimal set of convenient 
          javascript functions (query, add-listeners, ajax, iterate, etc). With this in mind, Uranium is the 
          best of both worlds - its primary purpose is to make it easy to create great widgets UI/UX, but if 
          you need to do something fancy, it gives you the tools you need to do so concisely.</p>
          
      <h3>Uranium is not designed for executing logic or site functions</h3>
        <p>Uranium makes the view (your UI/UX) rely on the model (your HTML). The declarative aspect 
          is not designed for performing functions. You wouldn't want to add attributes to an element 
          to perform some js logic (this is exactly why 'onclicks' should be avoided) - thats what 
          events/listeners/callbacks are for.</p>
